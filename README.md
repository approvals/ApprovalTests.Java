ApprovalTests.Java
==================
Capturing Human Intelligence - ApprovalTests is an open source assertion/verification library to aid unit testing.

It is compatible with JUnit 3 & 4 and TestNG

What can it be used for?
---

Approval Tests can be used for verifying objects that require more than a simple assert. They also come prepackaged with utilities for some common .Net scenarios including


- HashMaps & Collections
- Long Strings
- Log Files
- JPanels
- Xml
- Html
- Json

How to get it
---
Unfortunately, I haven't added this to maven repo yet. Simply download the zip from the releases tab and add the jar to your project.

Examples
---
ApprovalTests eats it own dogfood, so the best examples are in the source code itself.

None the less,  Here's a quick look at some
[Sample Code](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Java/blob/master/java/org/approvaltests/tests/demos/SampleArrayTest.java)

	public class SampleArrayTest extends TestCase
	{
		public void testList() throws Exception
		{
			String[] names = {"Llewellyn", "James", "Dan", "Jason", "Katrina"};
			Arrays.sort(names);
			Approvals.verifyAll("", names);
		}
	}

Will Produce a File

    SampleTest.TestList.received.txt
    [0] = Dan
    [1] = James
    [2] = Jason
    [3] = Katrina
    [4] = Llewellyn

Simply rename this to SampleTest.testList.approved.txt and the test will now pass.

Approved File Artifacts
---

The `*.approved.*` files must be checked into source your source control. This can be an issue with git as it will change the line endings.
The suggested fix is to add
`*.approved.* binary` to your `.gitattributes`

Developer notes
----------------

If you would like to build this project locally, install Apache ant,
then use these commands:

     ant "Publish    Spun" -buildfile build/build.xml
     cp spun/target/spun.jar java/jars/
     ant "Publish    ApprovalTests" -buildfile build/build.xml
     cp approvals/target/ApprovalTests.jar java/jars
     ant "Publish    HtmlLocker" -buildfile build/build.xml
     ant "Publish    CounterDisplay" -buildfile build/build.xml

This will build jar files under the target folder for each respective project. At present you have to 
copy the built jar files by hand in between ant steps, since the subprojects depned on one another.
Soon this will be handled by maven instead.
