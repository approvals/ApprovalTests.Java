## Why

It is our belief that checked exceptions were a mistake in the Java language. Fortunately, Java provides two methods for 
unchecked exceptions: `RuntimeException` and `Error`. Checked exceptions will also show up in the signatures of methods,
creating troubles with lambdas 

Approval Utilities provides the following techniques for converting checked exceptions into unchecked exceptions.

## 1. Throw as error (Exception)
The most basic method to do this is to wrap a checked exception in a runtime exception. Here is an example of this:
<!-- snippet: throw_as_error -->
<a id='snippet-throw_as_error'></a>
```java
try
{
  methodThatMightThrowCheckedException();
  methodThatMightThrowRuntimeException();
  methodThatMightThrowError();
}
catch (Throwable t)
{
  throw ObjectUtils.throwAsError(t);
}
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

There are two things to note in this implementation.

### A. Unnecessary Wrapping
`ObjectUtils.throwAsError` will not wrap `Error` or `RuntimeException` as they are already unchecked.

### B. Returning Exceptions
`ObjectUtils.throwAsError` pretends that it will return an `Error`. The reason it does this is so that the calling code
can pretend to throw it. In practice, `throwAsError()` will always throw the `Error`. So whether or not you specify 
a `throw` at the calling code is irrelevant to the execution, but can be helpful for compilation of the calling code.

## 2. Throw as error (Action/Function)
If you want to run a small piece of code without the overhead of the try/catch block, you can accomplish this through
the use of lambdas. Here are examples with and without return values:
<!-- snippet: throw_as_error_lambda -->
<a id='snippet-throw_as_error_lambda'></a>
```java
ObjectUtils.throwAsError(() -> methodThatMightThrowCheckedException());
int i = ObjectUtils.throwAsError(() -> methodThatMightThrowCheckedExceptionWithReturnValue());
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

## 3. Wrapping Actions/Functions
If the issue is in the signature of the lambda you will need to convert from a lambda whose signature allows checked
exceptions to one that doesn't. To do this you will use either `Actions.unchecked()` / `Functions.unchecked()`

Here's an example which allows us to wrap a lambda that throws an `IOException`:
<!-- snippet: throw_as_unchecked -->
<a id='snippet-throw_as_unchecked'></a>
```java
Queryable<String> paths = files.select(Functions.unchecked(
    // throws IOException
    s -> new File(s).getCanonicalPath()));
```
