* remove all checked exceptions
* remove all warnings
* make intellij aware of if it is running and only launch then
* handle manual install of intellij
* write docs on how to make a custom reporter

bug under windows:
interesting, it opens both files with WinMerge (diff tool) once the test fails
and WinMerge says that the files are identical
although different encodings
so approvaltests fails to 1) write the result as UTF8 encoded file
and 2) read the non-UTF8 file properly that it just created
notepad++ says the generated txt file is ANSI
well, if I read the ANSI file as it was UTF8 then I see the difference :stuck_out_tongue:
reading as ANSI I see "wifistä"
reading as UTF8 I see: <encoding errors>
WinMerge says the encoding is "1252"




compatible with jdk 6 is probably not true, java nio package is used in a few places already.

discuss: no need to close resources in our tests since jvm shuts down afterwards?

then look at the list and decide if we commit it too or rather tasks on github or something
today's goal I'd like to look into using approval tests with junit5's @ParameterizedTest
https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Java/issues/51
https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Java/issues/36
-> might require introduction of junit5 to the project though (which is good but also some extra work)

* 404 for Website link in readme
* 404 for Getting Started Doc link in readme
* add gradle file to starter project?
* delete SpunConstants ?
* delete Fedex ?
* update readme, how to get it, update to latest version and also add line for gradle
* update readme, examples, show wih junit5 instead of 3?
* publish release also on github: https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository
* update tests to use junit5 engine (which can continue executing junit 4 tests but also junit 5)

* junit5 tests create both files (empty approved file) while junit4 only creates recieved file on first run
* !!! ClipboardReporter does not work with Junit5 !!!

* !!! FileUtils.writeFile (160) relies on platform default + 16 more. colleague had failing test on windows.

* newer dependency version available:

!!! talk with Llewellyn again about his thoughts about versioning again. was interesting yesterday regarding
"if it's breaking change, there should be only one change" !!!
