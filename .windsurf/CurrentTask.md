# Creating the Arlo Commit Notation Process file
Arlo's commit notation is a prefix, a two-character prefix to a get message that helps us to determine both the risk and the intent of each commit. Our goal here is to data mine our existing commits to put together a process file describing how to use it and where to use it.

The document we are building is `.windsurf/ArloCommitNotation.process.md`.

## Interacting with Git
Two mechanisms in which to interact with our Git repo. One is the Git command line and the other is the GitHub CLI. You are welcome to use either.

## Current feature we are implementing

## To Do
- [ ] Gather data

## Gathering Data
Using the CLI, get 50 recent examples from this repo of the commit notation and hashes and put them into a file. Add the data you need about the commit that you think is relevant. Put all of this into a file called `example_commits.txt` in the `.windsurf` directory.
