## ApprovalTests

**NEVER** approve a test for us, the user will allways do that. If you believe the `.approved.` file needs to be changed, prompt the user.


## Running Tests

To run tests: `./build_and_test.sh`
**note:** this will auto-format the code.
You do not need to worry about formatting.

## Checking status
use: `./.windsurf/scripts/git_status.sh`


## Commiting Code
Use [Arlo Commit Notation](../ArloCommitNotation.process.md)
* ALWAYS run tests before commiting
* NEVER commit code if tests are failing
* ALWAYS suggest a commit message and confirm with the user before commiting.


### Message
Choose the most important piece and use it as the title.
If extra details are need add them after a line break.
Add the Co-authors. Ask if you haven't confirmed for this session.
