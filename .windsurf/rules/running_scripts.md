**ALWAYS** add the STARTER_CHARACTER followed by space at the start of your reply. 
The STARTER_CHARACTER will change for each process file that is in progress.

Default STARTER_CHARACTER = ðŸ§©


## ApprovalTests

**NEVER** approve a test for us, the user will allways do that. If you believe the `.approved.` file needs to be changed, prompt the user.


## Running Tests

To run tests: `./build_and_test.sh`
**note:** this will auto-format the code.
You do not need to worry about formatting.

## Commiting Code
